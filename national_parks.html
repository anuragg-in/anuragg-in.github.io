<div class = "heading">National parks entrance fees and reservation</div>
<div class = "text">Some national parks require reservations for crowd control, in addition to entrance fees. For visits to multiple national parks, consider buying an <a class="link" href="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm#america-the-beautiful-passes">annual pass</a>. Alternatively, you can enter national parks for free and without reservations by entering outside of their working hours.

<div class = "heading">Which car to rent?</div>
<div class = "text">I am 5'11" and I could sleep comfortably in a standard SUV (Hyundai Santa Fe). In an intermediate SUV (Toyota RAV4), my foot was hanging out, so either I had to sleep diagonally or put some luggage below my foot. Both of these options can accomodate two adults for sleeping.</div>
<div class = "separator"></div>

<div class = "heading">Car insurance</div>
<div class = "text">Most rental companies offer car damage waiver and third-party liability insurance, but it's expensive. Instead, get a credit card that includes free car insurance, such as those from Capital One, Chase, or American Express. Alternatively, <a class="link" href="https://membership.aaa.com/">AAA membership</a> provides these insurances with additional benefits at a better price.</div>
<div class = "separator"></div>

<div class = "heading">What to eat?</div>
<div class = "text">Tortillas, canned foods, and ready-to-eat noodles (you can usually find hot water at gas stations or grocery stores in national parks). Bring fruits for easy snacks. If you can buy a portable gas stove and cylinder, you can cook regular meals, though I didn't try this. Plastic utensils are available at Walmart, gas stations, or delis.</div>
<div class = "separator"></div>

<div class = "heading">How to manage stuffs in your car?</div>
<div class = "text">Bring a couple of trash bags for waste and dirty laundry. Trash bins are easy to find, but laundry machines in national parks are rare.</div>

<div class = "heading">Exploring national parks</div>
<div class = "text">Check the <a class="link" href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Park Service website</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-apps.htm">app</a> for park info. Upon entry, you'll get maps and a newsletter with latest updates. For more details, talk to a ranger at visitor centers. For hiking, it is advised to download maps.me in advance as national parks have limited internet connectivity.</div>

<div class = "vertical-space"></div>
<div class = "text">
One way to minimize loss is to decrease individual's exposure to real time market. This can be easily achieved by an investment on battery storage. Size of battery is identified by solving an optimization problem to minimize expected cost in long run. It turns out that investing on a shared battery resource is better than investing on individual battery storage, therefore, highlighting the benefit of coalition formation.<br>
The presentation also discusses other models with different objective functions, and improvement in individual's benefit under coalition formation.
