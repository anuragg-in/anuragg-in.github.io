<div class = "text">My research interest lies in the domain of power electronics, microprocessors, embedded systems and digital design. Specifically, I like to focus in the areas of hardware architecture design and efficient coding techniques. In my leisure, I like reading literatures on PCB design guidelines to improve noise characteristics of a system.<div class = "vertical-space"></div>
Some of the intriguing areas that I would like to accrue my knowledge are grounding schemes for mixed-signal system design and design of RFID. During my recent encounter with an RFID application, I faced a familiar problem of impassability of RF signals through metal. Fortunately for my application, a pragmatic alternative to metal circumnavigated the problem. In certain prospective industrial applications pertaining to Internet of Things (IoT), it is essential for a RFID tag to be embeddeded inside a metal slab. Several literatures have been proposed to tackle such cases even though the solutions remain economically unfeasible to be implemented on a large scale. Therefore, the area offers an enriching concept to pursue.<div class = "vertical-space"></div>
Further, I have worked on projects related to image processing and computer vision for industrial based applications and remote sensing. Specific area of interests are camera calibration, 3d reconstruction, image stitching and feature classification.</div>
