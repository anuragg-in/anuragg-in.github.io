<h1>Improving UI on a Webpage with Progressive Image Loading</h1>
In this article, we compare two ways of loading images on a website: static and progressive image loading. How we load images can significantly impact user experience and page performance. Static loading fetches all images at once; this causes network congestion when there are large numbers of images on a webpage. On the other hand, progressive loading fetches images in stages, enhancing speed and efficiency.
<h2>Progressive image loading</h2>
When there are large number of images on a webpage, most of them are not within the viewport. Therefore, loading them all at once creates burden on network. Progressive loading exploits this idea to load images efficiently. Let us understand the mathematics that makes progressive image loading efficient. Consider a high resolution 4k (3840x2160) image. Assuming each pixel contains 1 unit of information, the entire image contains 8,294,400 units of information. The amount of information translates to the size of the image. More the information, larger the size of the image. Static image loading technique transfers 8294400 units of information, all at once, when the page loads. On the other hand, progressive image loading only loads a compressed image when the page loads. Let's say that the compressed image of resolution 240x135, obtained by scaling the original image by 16, is used. The compressed image contains 32,400 units of information, 16*16=256 times less than the original image. Now comes the important step. In progressive loading, the browser monitors the user's scroll position and fetches images from the server immediately before they appear on the viewport. This technique splits the network bandwidth usage into chunks.<br>
