<h2>Head, Meta, OG, Twitter tags</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Specify a region for your site. This can affect site ranking in search results for location-dependent queries. Put in top so that it is processed before other information about page.</li>
		<li>Canonical link to avoid duplicate content by crawler. For e.g. https://www.anuragg.in/ and https://www.anuragg.in/index.html are duplicate contents. Put this after meta tags but before open graph tags.</li>
		<li>A general recommendation is to keep your page description between 110 and 160 characters, although Google can sometimes show longer snippets.</li>
		<li>Title length to be less than 70 characters. Make it unique and relevant to best describe the page content.</li>
