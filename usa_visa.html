<div class = "title">Timeline for USA business/tourist (B1/B2) visa application</div>
<hr>
<div class = "text">
	I applied for the <a class="link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html">USA tourist visa</a> under the <a class="link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/important-update-on-waivers-of-the-interview-requirement-for-certaing-nonimmigrant-visa-applicants.html">interview-waiver program</a> from New Delhi, India. Here's the timeline for my application process.<br>
	<b>18-Jul-2024:</b> Paid the $185 application fee and scheduled an appointment for the next day for document submission.<br>
	<b>19-Jul-2024:</b> Submitted the document (DS-160 confirmation, 1 photo, new passport, passport with existing USA visa) at the VAC, New Delhi. You also need to carry a printout of the appointment confirmation page. They will stamp this as an acknowledgement receipt. The officials are very strict about the photo requirement. So, ensure that the background of the photo is white and that it has been shot recently. There is a photo studio, photocopy and other services available right infront of the VAC but the service fee is high. As per the officially available information, it takes 7-10 working days for processing the tourist visa.<br>
	<b>22-Jul-2024:</b> The <a class="link" href="https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?eQs=o%2fiS8zDpeAKjMWCuebHqOw%3d%3d">CEAC website</a> says "Application received: Your case is open and ready for your interview, fingerprints, and required documents. If you have already had your interview, please check your status after two business days. If no interview was required, please check back in two business days for the status of your application. For more information, please visit U.S. Embassy New Delhi.".

	<i>Remarks<br>
	<ul>
	<li>I qualified for interview-waiver as I had a F-1 visa which was still valid.</li>
	<li>As the document submission counter was outside the VAC, I could carry my mobile phone and a bag. Although for faster processing, some people who did not have a bag or mobile were also sent inside the VAC.</li>
	<!-- <li>I did not opt for the premium lounge service while biometrics enrollment at the VFS centre and the entire process did not take more than half an hour.</li>
	<li>I did not opt for the SMS notification service. VFS sent me numerous notifications via e-mails on the status of my application.</li>
 	<li>The delay between the passport request and the passport submission was due to my travel plans. Moreover, there was an extended weekend holiday in IRCC office, Bangalore, India from 16-Sep-2023 to 18-Sep-2023 due to Ganesh Chaturthi.</li> -->

<div class = "text">
One way to minimize loss is to decrease individual's exposure to real time market. This can be easily achieved by an investment on battery storage. Size of battery is identified by solving an optimization problem to minimize expected cost in long run. It turns out that investing on a shared battery resource is better than investing on individual battery storage, therefore, highlighting the benefit of coalition formation.<br>
The presentation also discusses other models with different objective functions, and improvement in individual's benefit under coalition formation.
