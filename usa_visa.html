<div class = "title">Timeline for US Business/Tourist (B1/B2) Visa Application</div>
<hr>
<div class = "text">
	Interview appointment dates for US visas have long waiting times in India and several other countries. Recently, the US relaxed the interview requirements to mitigate delays for existing US visa holders. Eligible applicants satisfying the conditions on their <a class="link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/important-update-on-waivers-of-the-interview-requirement-for-certaing-nonimmigrant-visa-applicants.html">website</a> can opt for document submission under the <a class="link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/important-update-on-waivers-of-the-interview-requirement-for-certaing-nonimmigrant-visa-applicants.html">interview-waiver program</a>. I applied for the <a class="link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html">US tourist visa (B1/B2)</a> under the interview-waiver program from New Delhi, India. Here's the timeline for my application process.<br>
	<b>18-Jul-2024:</b> Paid the $185 application fee and scheduled an appointment for the next day for document submission.<br>
	<b>19-Jul-2024:</b> Submitted the document (DS-160 confirmation, 1 photo, new passport, passport with existing US visa) at the VAC, New Delhi. You also need to carry a printout of the appointment confirmation page. They will stamp this as an acknowledgement receipt. The officials are very strict about the photo requirement. So, ensure that the background of the photo is white and that it has been shot recently. There is a photo studio, photocopy and other services available right infront of the VAC but the service fee is high. As per the officially available information, it takes 7-10 working days for processing the tourist visa.<br>
	<b>22-Jul-2024:</b> The <a class="link" href="https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?eQs=o%2fiS8zDpeAKjMWCuebHqOw%3d%3d">CEAC website</a> says <i>"Application received: Your case is open and ready for your interview, fingerprints, and required documents. If you have already had your interview, please check your status after two business days. If no interview was required, please check back in two business days for the status of your application."</i><br>
	<b>23-Jul-2024:</b> The <a class="link" href="https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?eQs=o%2fiS8zDpeAKjMWCuebHqOw%3d%3d">CEAC website</a> says <i>"Approved: The consular officer has approved your application subject to final processing by the consular section that is necessary to issue your visa. When that processing is complete, the status will change to "Issued". However, a final screening step must still be completed prior to issuance that could lead a consular officer to conclude that you are not eligible for a visa. If that occurs, the consular officer will notify you that your application has been denied and your status will change to "Refused"."</i><br>
	<b>24-Jul-2024:</b> The <a class="link" href="https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx?eQs=o%2fiS8zDpeAKjMWCuebHqOw%3d%3d">CEAC website</a> says <i>"Issued: The consular section has completed processing your application and your visa has been issued. If you do not receive your passport and visa within 10 working days, please contact the embassy or consulate where you submitted your application. If at any time additional information is discovered that indicates you may no longer be eligible for a visa, the U.S. government may revoke your visa. See Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act."</i><br>
	<b>25-Jul-2024:</b> Passport ready for pick-up.

	<i>Remarks<br>
	<ul>
	<li>I qualified for interview-waiver based on my valid study visa (F1).
	</li>
	<li>As the document submission counter was outside the VAC, I could carry my mobile phone and a bag. Although for faster processing, some people who did not have a bag or mobile were also sent inside the VAC.</li>
	<li>20-Jul-2024 and 21-Jul-2024 were weekends. Hence, the delay in status update.</li>
	<!-- <li>I did not opt for the premium lounge service while biometrics enrollment at the VFS centre and the entire process did not take more than half an hour.</li>
	<li>I did not opt for the SMS notification service. VFS sent me numerous notifications via e-mails on the status of my application.</li>
 	<li>The delay between the passport request and the passport submission was due to my travel plans. Moreover, there was an extended weekend holiday in IRCC office, Bangalore, India from 16-Sep-2023 to 18-Sep-2023 due to Ganesh Chaturthi.</li> -->

<div class = "text">
One way to minimize loss is to decrease individual's exposure to real time market. This can be easily achieved by an investment on battery storage. Size of battery is identified by solving an optimization problem to minimize expected cost in long run. It turns out that investing on a shared battery resource is better than investing on individual battery storage, therefore, highlighting the benefit of coalition formation.<br>
The presentation also discusses other models with different objective functions, and improvement in individual's benefit under coalition formation.
