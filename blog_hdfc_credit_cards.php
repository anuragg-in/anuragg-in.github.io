<div class = "text">Competitive annual fees along with their waiver policies, rewards programme. Lounge access (if applicable) can be availed by add-on cardholders too. Bonus rewards on reaching spend milestones.<div class = "vertical-space"></div>
Drawbacks: Add-on (supplementary) cards come with same card number as that of primary card holder. Hence, one cannot utilise the add-on cards to avail an offer on online/offline shopping multiple times from a single account.<br>
Smartbuy provides exlusive offers on Amazon, Flipkart, etc. but it takes 90 days for bank to fulfill reward points/cashbacks to user's account. Moreover, there is a lack of transparency i.e. unless you personally keep track of all the reward points/cashback, there is no way whatsoever to track them through their netbanking.</div>

Diners International: Although, their forex markup fees is 2% (+GST), their currency conversion rates are poor compare to Visa/Mastercard. There is no additional rewards on reaching a spend milestone.
