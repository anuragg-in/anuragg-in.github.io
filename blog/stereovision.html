                <h1>Stereovision using more than two image sets</h1>
    <p>This projects aims to extract depth information from more than two image sets, thereby, improving accuracy of depth map. To do so, depth map set, obtained from all valid pair of images, is averaged out to reduce number of unresolved pixels in final depth map. For comparison, ground truth for depth map was also obtained using depth sensor.</p>
