          city of Lucknow which is nationwide renowned as the city of
          'Nawabs'. I enjoy visiting unexplored places manageable on
          foot. Walking all the way down to Ladakh is one of the challenge on my
          wager list.</div>-->

          <div class = "text">I am a M.Tech graduate from the Department of <a class="link" href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in">Systems and Control</a> at the <a class="link" href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>. My advisor was <a class="link" href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/">Prof. Ankur A. Kulkarni</a>. I worked on applying weak duality in conjunction with convex relaxation to derive lower bounds for joint source-channel coding problems with feedback.
          <div class="vertical-space"></div>
          Earlier, I completed my B.Tech (with Honors) in <a class="link" href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web">Electrical Engineering</a> along with a minor in <a class="link" href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/">Industrial Design</a> from the <a class="link" href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>. My B.Tech project on design of flyback converter was supervised by <a class="link" href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~mukul/">Prof. Mukul C. Chandorkar</a>, and the studio project requirement at Industrial Design Centre was guided by <a class="link" href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/sumant/">Prof. Sumant M. Rao</a>. I am also a recipient of the <a class="link" href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/urop.jsp">Undergraduate Research Award</a> for my contribution to the field of Computational Electromagnetics.
          <div class="vertical-space"></div>
          I have collaborated with <a class="link" href="https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=jboland">Prof. John Boland</a> as a summer intern at <a class="link" href="http://www.crann.tcd.ie/">CRANN Institute</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, for the period encompassing May 2015 to July 2015 under the <a class="link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/">Erasmus</a> program. Moreover, I was a Research Scientist at <a class="link" href="http://www.systemantics.com/">Systemantics India Pvt. Ltd.</a> under the supervision of <a class="link" href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/jagannathraju">Dr. Jagannath Raju</a> for the period beginning from November 2014 to December 2014. </div>
