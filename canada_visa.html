	<i>Remarks<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Even though I applied from USA, I had no issues with biometrics and passport submission in India.</li>
	<li>I did not opt for the premium lounge service while biometrics enrollment at the VFS centre and the entire process did not take more than half an hour.</li>
	<li>I did not opt for the SMS notification service. VFS sent me numerous notifications via e-mails on the status of my application.</li>
 	<li>The delay between the passport request and the passport submission was due to my travel plans. Moreover, there was an extended weekend holiday in IRCC office, Bangalore, India from 16-Sep-2023 to 18-Sep-2023 due to Ganesh Chaturthi.</li>

<div class = "text">
One way to minimize loss is to decrease individual's exposure to real time market. This can be easily achieved by an investment on battery storage. Size of battery is identified by solving an optimization problem to minimize expected cost in long run. It turns out that investing on a shared battery resource is better than investing on individual battery storage, therefore, highlighting the benefit of coalition formation.<br>
The presentation also discusses other models with different objective functions, and improvement in individual's benefit under coalition formation.
